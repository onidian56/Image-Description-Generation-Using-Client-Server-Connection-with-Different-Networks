# Image Description Generation Using Client-Server Connection with Different Networks

## Project Overview
This project implements a distributed animal image classification system that enables communication between devices across different networks using standard email protocols (**SMTP and POP3**) as a transport layer. 

The system is designed using a client-server architecture:
- The **client module**, developed and implemented by me, captures images and sends them to the server via email.
- The **server module**, also authored by me, receives the image from email, processes it using a deep learning model, and sends back classification results via email.

The classification model, integrated by team members, analyzes the image to identify the animal and generate a detailed description. This creates a fully automated and asynchronous pipeline, with no need for direct IP communication â€” making it suitable for isolated or firewalled environments.

My core focus in this project was designing and implementing the **email-based communication infrastructure** (`client.py` and `server.py`) that powers the cross-network exchange.

## Architecture

The system follows a client-server architecture where communication happens across different networks through email protocols.

## Components

### Client Side (PC 1)
- Captures images using a webcam or selects existing images
- Packages and sends images via SMTP to a predefined email address
- Periodically checks for response emails containing classification results
- Displays the received animal descriptions to the user

### Server Side (PC 2)
- Continuously monitors a designated email inbox using POP3
- Downloads image attachments from received emails
- Processes images using a pre-trained PyTorch animal classification model
- Generates detailed descriptions including scientific name, common name, characteristics, and habitat
- Sends classification results back to the client via email

### Classification Model
- Pre-trained PyTorch deep learning model for animal classification
- Returns comprehensive information including:
  - Scientific name
  - Common name
  - Description
  - Habitat
  - Conservation status (endangered)
  - Safety information (dangerous/poisonous/venomous)
  - Classification confidence (probability)

    end
    
    subgraph Response
        A4 -->|Display| A5[Classification Results]
    end
```

## How It Works

1. **Image Acquisition**:
   - The client application activates the webcam and captures an image
   - The image is temporarily saved on the client system

2. **Image Transmission**:
   - The client packages the image as an email attachment
   - Email is sent using SMTP protocol to a predefined server email address
   - The email subject includes a timestamp for tracking purposes

3. **Server Processing**:
   - The server continuously checks the designated email inbox using POP3
   - When an email with an image attachment is found, the server downloads it
   - The image is processed through the animal classification model

4. **Classification**:
   - The PyTorch model analyzes the image and classifies the animal
   - A complete description is generated with multiple attributes
   - If the confidence level is below 20%, the system returns "Could not identify"

5. **Result Transmission**:
   - The server packages the classification results in a plain text email
   - The response is sent back to the client's email address

6. **Result Display**:
   - The client checks for and retrieves the response email
   - The classification results are displayed to the user

### Classification Example

When an image of a tiger is sent through the system, the result might look like:

```json
{
  "scientific_name": "panthera-tigris",
  "common_name": "Tiger",
  "description": "The largest of the big cats, recognized by its orange coat with black stripes.",
  "habitat": "Forests, grasslands, and wetlands across Asia",
  "endangered": "endangered",
  "dangerous": "True",
  "poisonous": "False",
  "venomous": "False",
  "probability": 97.79
}
```
